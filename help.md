#Deathrun
##How to play
There are two teams: **Runners** and **Deaths**. The objective of the Runners is to complete the course without getting caught in any traps. The objective of the Deaths is to trigger the traps in a way that will kill all the Runners in the most efficient way possible.

*Deaths - Press buttons, get kills.*<br>
*Runners - Run, and don't die.*

##Tactics
###Runner Tactics
Runners can **bait the traps** in order to cause the Deaths to trigger them without getting a kill. This involves techniques such as **air-strafing, bhopping**, and even teammates **distracting the Deaths** while they try and trigger the traps. Runners should do whatever they can to avoid dying, however dirty or dodgy their tactics may be.

###Death Tactics
Deaths can take advantage of this, however. Prediction and gamesense is key - Good Deaths can read the Runner's movements and predict when the Runner is about to try and cross the trap, as opposed to when they are trying to bait the trap. If a teammate is trying to distract you, you can expect the Runner to try and cross the trap in the moment that they think you're distracted. Pay attention!
