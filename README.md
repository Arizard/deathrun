## Information

Deathrun is a garrysmod gamemode which involves two teams - **Runners** and **Deaths** - and a series of elaborate death traps. The Runners must dodge, bait, and distract in order to avoid certain death and complete the course. The Deaths must do whatever they can to prevent the Runners from achieving their goal.


## Installation

* Copy **deathrun-master** into your **/garrysmod/gamemodes** directory.
* Rename **deathrun-master** to **deathrun**.
* In your **server.cfg**, add or modify a line such as the following:

* That's it!
