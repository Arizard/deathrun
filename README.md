##Information

Deathrun is a garrysmod gamemode which involves two teams - **Runners** and **Deaths** - and a series of elaborate death traps. The Runners must dodge, bait, and distract in order to avoid certain death and complete the course. The Deaths must do whatever they can to prevent the Runners from achieving their goal.


##Installation
* Download the .zip of this repository by clicking the button on the right.
* Copy **deathrun-master** into your **/garrysmod/gamemodes** directory.
* Rename **deathrun-master** to **deathrun**.
* In your **server.cfg**, add or modify a line such as the following:

* If you prefer to add it to your command line, add or modify a line such as the following 
<pre>+gamemode deathrun </pre>
* That's it!

* _Revlak (Revlak's Palace) ( STEAM_0:0:39407576 )_ - this guy is just a dickhead skid who likes to DDoS anything with a heartbeat lmao
