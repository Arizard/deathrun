#Arizard's Deathrun

Yet another Deathrun gamemode for Garrysmod. I plan to include features such as map start/end zones (with hooks for customization), button claiming, easy scoreboard customization, appealing HUD and a focus on graphical interfaces for admins and players. The gamemode will also include formatted gamemode chat messages and an easy way to add chat commands. Also features css weapons by default.
