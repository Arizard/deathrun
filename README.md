#Arizard's Deathrun

This is a little project I'm working on every now and then because I'm sick of the current deathrun gamemode being used. This gamemode will feature button claiming, map starts+ends, analytics, default weapons and more custom features which should be standard for deathrun. Also the interface will be slightly nicer.
